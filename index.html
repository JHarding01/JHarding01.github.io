        <p>
            The Affinity Diagram organizes brainstorming ideas into categories to better understand the barriers veterans face when entering the civilian workforce.
             It highlights issues in education, financial stability, employer communication, and technology access. 
             This structure clarifies project priorities and provides a foundation for designing an app or website to guide veterans through career transitions.

        <p>
            The TransiTech sketches showcase three user perspectives:
                <br><strong>Marcus (Veteran)</strong> : focuses on learning, community, and profile management.
                <br><strong>Sarah (Counselor)</strong> : monitors veteran progress and mentors through data-driven insights.
                <br><strong>Alex (Employer)</strong> : searches for qualified veterans, reviews certifications, and initiates interviews.
                <br><br>
                Together, they demonstrate how TransiTech bridges the gap between military service and civilian tech careers.
